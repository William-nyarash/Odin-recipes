   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>This warm and hearty chicken dinner with apples and onions is perfect for the fall. </p>
   <p>Onions are simmered in apple cider and chicken stock before being baked with chicken thighs, apples, and cream.  </p>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>4 (4 ounce) bone-in, skin on chicken thighs </li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, sliced</li>
    <li>1 cup apple cider</li>
    <li>½ cup chicken stock</li>
    <li>½ tablespoon fresh thyme leaves</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 medium apples, sliced</li>
    <li>¼ cup heavy cream</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Season both sides of chicken thighs with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep oven-proof skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add chicken thighs to hot oil and cook until browned on both sides, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Add sliced onions to the skillet and sauté until they just start to brown, about 3 minutes. Pour in apple cider and chicken stock, scraping the bottom of the pan to loosen any browned bits. Stir in thyme and salt. Simmer until onions are soft, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Add chicken back to the skillet and spoon some sauce over the top. Arrange sliced apples around chicken. Cover the skillet with a lid or aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove skillet from the oven and carefully uncover. Transfer chicken from the skillet to a plate and keep warm. Whisk heavy cream and cornstarch together in a small bowl. Stir gently into sauce in the skillet. Place chicken back into the skillet and spoon some of sauce over chicken.</li>
        <li>Return skillet to the oven and bake, uncovered, until the chicken is no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, and an instant-read thermometer inserted near bone reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 15 minutes more. Serve chicken and apples with sauce.</li>
    </ul>
